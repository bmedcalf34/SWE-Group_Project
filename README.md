<em> User Story I </em>

Implemented by Maryam Botrus

My revised user story would be for a typical end-user Joe 
Joe is an overweight man who wants to lose weight and is unable to do so. He finds his way to our application and makes an account

Username: Joe password: Lose weight

Joe wants to understand how he can lose weight via dieting so he navigates to the Diet Selection button on the main screen after creating his account.
From this Joe can get suggested meals from either the water weight or lose weight diet recommendations.
Joe is happy with our application and goes on to lose 100 lbs from his new water diet. He also develops acute malnutrition as our diet recommendations are not the best.
This functionality encompasses over 300 lines of code across signup.html, login.html, index.html the required database code in app.py and the diet selection and diet_selection.html screens.

Michael Phillips is an Olympic swimmer who cares quite a bit about his macros. He also has poor eyesight and is unable to read food labels. After navigating to the Nutritiona app he wants to be able to count the macros of everything he is eating. Fortunately for Michael he keeps good track of all his ingredients and meals.
Michael visits the front page of the app and navigates to the nutrition menu. From here he searches the calories and nutritional value for 1 whole chicken, an apple and a sack of flour.
Michael then adds the macros in his excel spreadsheet and calculates his vitamin and caloric balance for his daily meal.
With his new found knowledge in hand Michael was able to better track his macros and win the United States gold at the Olympics.

This user story consists of the app.route("/nutrition") method from app.py along with the nutrition.html document and several lines of code on the main page that enable Michael to navigate through
